## Introduction

Networking forms the backbone of any distributed system, and as a DevOps engineer, having a solid grasp of networking basics is crucial. This repository covers key networking concepts, tools, and practical examples tailored for DevOps workflows.

## Why Networking is Important for DevOps

As a DevOps engineer, you often work with:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Ensuring connectivity between systems for seamless code deployment.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Configuring virtual networks, firewalls, and load balancers.
- **Container Orchestration**: Managing network policies and service discovery in Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing issues in distributed systems using networking tools.

Understanding networking basics allows you to design and troubleshoot efficient and secure systems.
